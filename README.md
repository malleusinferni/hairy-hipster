# Tips

1. Bigger monsters hit harder. Average size is decided by species.

2. You can heal by **rest**ing. Do it when you're alone so monsters don't attack you.

3. You can leave the game by climbing back **up** the well. If you've killed every monster, you "win." If not, you "lose."

# Bugs

The game's not finished, and won't be for a long time. I just started making it recently. Something like 99% of the "cool stuff" is not implemented.

More immediately, there are glitches in the way the game describes things. You can see a couple of them in the transcript. You'll notice others if you look at corpses or certain rooms. The whole description system is due for a rewrite, so these problems are on my todo list.
